Case Study: Customer Churn Prediction 

Background:
A leading telecommunications company, is facing a significant challenge with customer churn. The company has been experiencing a high rate of customer attrition, leading to revenue loss and a decline in market share. To address this issue, it wants to implement a machine learning solution for predicting customer churn.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn. By proactively identifying at-risk customers, the company aims to implement targeted retention strategies to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Data Description:
The dataset contains historical customer data including demographic information, service usage, account information, churn status etc. 

The dataset is labeled, with churn status as the target variable (binary: churned or not churned).

Legend:
* Age: Age of the customer
* Gender: Male (0) & Female (1)
* Income: Customer Income
* Account_Length: Period of association with the telecom provider (months)
* Contract Type: Type of contract that the customer has opted for (Features and associated services may vary accordingly) - Tier 1 (0), Tier 2 (1), Tier 3 (2)
* Call Duration - Average call duration in minutes during a given day
* Data Usage - Average data consumption during a given day
* Churn - Churned (1) / Not-Churned (0)

Tasks:
* Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
* Feature Importance Analysis
* Model Selection and Evaluation

Deliverables:
* Jupyter Notebook documenting the end-to-end process (Note: Code should carry the relevant comments, wherever required)
* Presentation summarising key findings, insights, and recommendations

Evaluation Criteria:
Candidates will be evaluated based on their ability to:
* Understand and interpret the dataset.
* Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering effectively.
* Select appropriate machine learning algorithms and tune hyper-parameters.
* Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.
* Provide actionable insights.
